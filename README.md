This is my "answer to" someone who tried to indicate I couldn't pretty quickly "spin up" a .NET Core Project with Angular on the "client side." My total time in this is less than two weeks, and less than full time at that!

Obviously, this is not complete for even the meager activities it preforms, but it's a good start.

My plan is to continue to add to it until I have a simple employee manager application.
