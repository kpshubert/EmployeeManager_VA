This is my "answer to" someone who tried to indicate I couldn't pretty quickly "spin up" a .NET Core Project with Angular on the "client side." My total time in this is less than two weeks, and less than full time at that!

Obviously, this is not complete for even the meager activities it preforms, but it's a good start.

My plan is to continue to add to it until I have a simple employee manager application.

As with all development projects, the job is never complete--that is to say, there's always more than can be done.

For what I wanted to demonstrate AT THIS MOMENT though, this project should do the job.

Should you find errors in any of my code, I'd SERIOUSLY appreciate it if you piont them out. After all, none of us is perfect.

One more thing, the connection to SQL Server is set up as a Microsoft SQL Server Express local database, with tables whose definitions can be found in the SQLScripts folder.

Check it out and let me know what you think!

Kurt.
